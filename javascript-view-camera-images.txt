Javascript - View Camera Images
------------------------------

The goal of this question is to display the images from a camera in a browser
via a simple read-only ajax-enabled web application. Write up a web page that
allows a user to:

    - view the latest image (just a jpeg or png) from a camera
    - move to the next or previous image from that camera
    - switch between cameras

You can assume there are a small (say 3-5) number of cameras to be displayed,
and each camera has a potentially large number of images associated with it
(i.e. an image was taken every 10 minutes for the last week).

Design a short API to allow the browser-based client to communicate with the
server. Document this API briefly - describe what calls the browser can make
and supply some example responses by the server.

It's up to you to choose how the user navigates around this page. However,
there should be UI elements that clearly achieve the functionality described in
each of three bullet points above. We're not looking for fancy design, as much
as we are well-structured javascript, html, and css.

You don't have to write up the server side of the API. Just assume it exists.

Since you don't have to write up the server side of the API, it's likely your
page won't actually function. That's ok. It should be clear it would function
if hooked up to the appropriate backend.

Bonus points: hook up your API calls to some static files on disk that mimic
server responses, and tie it all together into a functioning page. Tar all your
files together for submission.
